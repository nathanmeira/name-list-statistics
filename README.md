# Name List Statistics

Find out the number of masculine and feminine names in a list.
> The logic compares the input list against separate lists for masculine and feminine names, producing a count of the occurrences in each category.

### Roadmap

- [x] Create wireframe
- [x] Code initial project
- [ ] Improve layout design
- [ ] Integrate with Google Spreadsheet API. Send output results "Not Found Names" to a spreadsheet for later categorization and feed the list accordingly.
- [ ] Integrate with ChatGPT. Use the model as a callback, letting it flag "Not Found Names" accordingly.
